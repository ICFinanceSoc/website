                        The ICFS <a href="http://www.iciclub.co.uk/" title="ICFS Investment Club" target="_blank"><strong>Investment Club</strong></a> is a platform for the students of Imperial College and Tanaka Business School to learn and discuss the opportunities of investing. Empowering members through participation, we believe first-hand experience is the best way to learn about the markets and understand the rationale of making stock choices. Along with tutorials we offer virtual trading competitions as well as the opportunity for members to group together and invest themselves.

                          <strong>Entrepreneurs Interactive</strong></a> was founded in summer 2006 as IC Entrepreneurs by a group of Imperial College postgraduate students. Last year we organised more than 10 events for over 500 attendants. The mission of Entrepreneurs Interactive is to foster entrepreneurship among students, staff and alumni of Imperial and promote entrepreneurial mind-set as a founder or manager of a start-up company. The club hosts events and provides resources to support the finding of innovations and facilitates networking with like-minded people, VCs and the Imperial College entrepreneurial community.
