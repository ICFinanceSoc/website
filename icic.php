        <p>The Imperial College Investment Club (ICIC) was formerly a subsidiary of the Imperial College Finance Society (ICFS), specialising in the trading and investing side of the financial world. The club had a rich history, with its many initiatives and opportunities helping its members find that dream job in trading or asset management year after year. The club had two main aims:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To educate its members through its proprietary educational programmes (for instance the TEC)
            <li>To give members first hand experience in trading live financial markets.
        </ul>
        <p>Educating members with the theory and providing them with a platform to apply that theory and gain practical experience was at the heart of the ICIC's ethos. However due to external restrictions on its trading activities, the ICIC had to cease many of its initiatives last year. In order to preserve the highly beneficial aspects of the ICIC that provided enormous value to members over the years, the ICIC merged with the ICFS. As a result, this year the benefits of the ICIC will continue to act as the springboard for future financial careers by opening themselves up to even more members than ever before. </p>
    <h2>TEC</h2>
    <p>The Trading Education Certificate (TEC) is our own proprietary educational programme, developed and delivered alongside Credit Suisse, which aims to provide our members with the technical knowledge to help kick-start a career in finance. To learn more about the TEC, click <a href="/tec">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Trading Competition</h2>
    <p>The ICFS is working with Markit to deliver a real-time trading simulation with live market prices across a range of asset classes; from equity indices and government bonds, to currencies and commodity contracts. This initiative puts you in the deep end and allows you to learn by doing. Some of the biggest investment banks use this very simulation to train their new traders and hone their trading techniques. Previous trading experience is absolutely not a prerequisite for this. We encourage everyone to use this as a learning experience, whether you're completely new to trading or if you already have a track record in the industry. Taking part in this trading game whilst taking the TEC course alongside it will help equip you with not only the theory but also the practical knowledge about finance to help you excel in interviews, assessment centres and ultimately the internships themselves.</p>
    <p>The trading game starts on the 14th October and runs until the 29th November, after which the best performers are invited by Morgan Stanley to explore the world of sales and trading at their European headquarters in Canary Wharf.</p>
