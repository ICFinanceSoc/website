<div id="icfs">
    <h3>ICFS</h3>
    <p class=displaytext>The Imperial College  Finance Society (ICFS) is the premier society for students looking for city  careers. With over 2400 members, we are the largest and most successful careers  focused society on campus. The results alone can be seen in the achievements of  the committee, with all those that have applied to date, achieving spring week  placements or internships, as well as numerous bursaries. The result of so many  members going on to get the city jobs that they have sought, is the growth of  an extensive network of alumni still involved with the society today. This  offers invaluable advice and experience to new members to help them land their  dream job. </p>
    <p>We hold regular interactive  events with leading Investment Banks and City firms. These events are aimed at  providing our members with information about job opportunities in the City, as  well as offering a forum to network with leading professionals and bright  individuals on campus.</p>
    <p>We also organise talks  and presentations on various financial topics such as derivatives, the recent  global financial crisis, emerging markets etc. These are given by prominent  speakers, who are experts in their respective fields.</p>
    <p>In addition to this we  are building relationships with other academic institutions worldwide, to share  ideas and collectively pool knowledge and resources. In 2007-2008 ICFS  initiated the UK’s very first student led Inter-University Trading Game (IUTG)  which saw about 500 students from Imperial College, Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick  and LSE take part. The IUTG has now become an annual event sponsored by RBS. With  2010 bringing about the first year of the UK Investment banking series (<a href="http://www.UIBS.co.uk">www.UIBS.co.uk</a>), if you fancy yourself  as a trader or a banker, there has never been a better time to join.</p>
    <p>Another great opportunity  available to members is the ICU Investment  Club. Following the impressive developments over the last year, this will  undoubtedly provide an excellent platform to learn and discuss the  opportunities of investing. Utilizing first-hand experience as the best way to  learn about the markets and understand the rationale of making stock choices. </p>
    <p>ICFS is known by all the  major recruiters in the ABC sectors, and mentioning you have taken the effort  to participate in these events could transfer your application from the 'maybe'  to the 'yes' pile. The sooner you get involved in our activities the better, so  all you first and second years out there, JOIN UP (get involved) and make sure  you get clued up about the job you want.</p>
